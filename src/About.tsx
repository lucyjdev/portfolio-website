              I started studying software development in July 2020, when I was
              on furlough. I was always curious about software development, and
              this felt like the perfect opportunity to explore it in more
              detail and to see if it was something I enjoyed and could succeed
              at. I completed the{" "}
              <a className="link" href="https://www.shecodes.io/workshop">
                SheCodes Introduction to Coding
              </a>{" "}
              workshop, which introduced me to HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After I
              returned to work in my new position of Customer Success Manager, I
              completed the{" "}
              <a className="link" href="https://www.shecodes.io/plus">
                SheCodes Plus
              </a>{" "}
              and{" "}
              <a className="link" href="https://www.shecodes.io/react">
                SheCodes React
              </a>{" "}
              workshops in the evenings and weekends over the next four months.
              In these courses I studied HTML, CSS and JavaScript in more detail
              and was introduced to React, Bootstrap, GitHub, Hosting with
              Netlify and using APIs. I created a web page as part of the
              ‘Introduction to Coding’ workshop, a

              I left my Customer Success role in July 2021 to focus on studying
              software development full time. Between July and December 2021, I
              completed the Udemy course{" "}
              <a
                className="link"
                href="https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-13-app-development-bootcamp/"
              >
                iOS and Swift – The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp
              </a>
              . As part of this bootcamp I have studied Storyboards, Auto
              Layout, Design Patterns and Code Structuring, Intermediate and
              Advanced Swift, Networking, JSON parsing, APIs, Core Location,
              Firebase, TableViews, CocoaPod dependencies, Command Line and
              Terminal, SwiftUI and declarative programming, Git, GitHub and
              version control, Local Data Persistence, Core ML, Create ML,
              ARKit, App Design and App Marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Following completion of the iOS App Development Bootcamp, I began
              developing an{" "}
              <a
                className="link"
                href="https://github.com/lucyj204/GroupEventsCalendar"
              >
                iOS collaborative events calendar app
              </a>{" "}
              for organising social events among friends. This has furthered my
              experience using Swift, CocoaPods, libraries such as Realm,
              FSCalendar, and SwipeCellKit, and utilities including URLSession,
              JSONEncoder and UITableView.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the data for groups and events needed to be synchronised
              between multiple devices, I moved from storing data using Realm to
              implementing a{" "}
              <a
                className="link"
                href="https://github.com/lucyj204/GroupEventsCalendarBackend"

                backend REST HTTP service using Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL and
                TypeScript
              </a>
              . I am still in the process of developing both my app and backend
              service. However, it has been a great learning experience with the
              work I have completed so far and has introduced me to new
              technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
              In early 2022, I started building this{" "}
              <a
                className="link"
                href="https://github.com/lucyj204/portfolio-website"

                portfolio website using TypeScript, React and Bootstrap
              </a>
              . I have also been working on a{" "}
              <a className="link" href="https://github.com/lucyj204/TimerSwift">
                timer app using Swift
              </a>
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              Between May 2022 and September 2022, I completed the{" "}
              <a
                className="link"
                href="https://codefirstgirls.com/courses/cfgdegree/"
              >
                Code First Girls Degree in Full Stack development
              </a>
              , which I will have my results for after 8 September. The Degree
              involved attending evening classes for four nights per week,
              completing homework assessments each week on the topics studied,
              completing two larger theory assessments covering Python, React,
              design principles and front-end libraries, and two closed book
              assessments covering Python theory and coding questions, Agile
              methodology, MySQL coding questions, time and space complexity
              questions and design principles. I also had the opportunity to
              collaborate on a group project over the course of four weeks, in
              which I focused primarily on creating the user interface for our
              project using React and integrating our front end and backend
              services.

              Outside of my courses I have been attending or viewing tech talks
              online. The talks include a Mongo DB conference, Apple Developer
              talks and online lectures and tutorials. I have spent time reading
              documentation and started to read ‘Structure and Interpretation of
              Computer Programs’ by Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with
              Julie Sussman. I have also been working through the ‘Computer
              Science Fundamentals’, ‘Pre-Algebra’ and ‘Algorithm Fundamentals’
              courses available on Brilliant, to further develop my knowledge of
              these topics.
